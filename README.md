Fantasy-Baseball-Auctioneer
===========================

This python program allows you to run a fantasy baseball auction (although it could be used for other sports). The list of players is populated from the input file players.xls and the list of owners from owners.xls. Every action within the system saves the current state of the program to output.xls.
